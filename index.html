			<p class="section-heading">More About Me</p>
			<p class="section-body">
				Based in <mark>Sydney, Australia</mark>, I am currently an undergraduate research student in games development and a software engineering contractor. I graduated from the <mark>University of Technology Sydney</mark>, with a Distinction in <mark>BSc. Information Technology</mark> in 2019, majoring in enterprise systems development and particularly focusing on web and mobile apps, I also have experience working in the software development field. Currently, I am undertaking an <mark>honours degree with a research focus in interactive drama systems</mark> for video games. I am particularly interested in building interactive drama systems which lean into emergent properties to provide games with valuable and dramatically interesting gameplay features.
				<br><br>
				In early 2019 I was also <mark>invited to present a game narrative review paper I had written at GDC</mark>, winning gold for my critical analysis of the game <i>Aviary Attorney</i> as selected by a panel of industry veteran narrative designers. And in 2020 I was named as one of the <mark>Australian Financial Review's (AFR) Top 100 Future Leaders</mark>, a competition that identifies the most promising graduates across multiple disciplines each year.
				<br><br>
				I love <mark>programming</mark> and enjoy spending my free time learning new tools and languages, which has provided me with a great deal of flexibility with regard to the kinds of projects I am able to work on, from games, to networking tools, and even analytics. However I also enjoy (and have experience with) a broad range of creative fields, including: <mark>gameplay and narrative design</mark>, <mark>UX&I design</mark>, music production and composition, and video editing.
				<br><br>
				If you were to ask me about what gets me out of bed in the morning, I would say it's making cool stuff. At my core, I am a creator, and I love to craft experiences, software, games, products, and many more amazing things. In this, I have developed a passion for learning - especially when I can apply it to my craft. So if I'm not working hard at my research, I'm likely at a game jam, learning a new skill, or off hiking somewhere.
